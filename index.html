	<h2>THE GREAT FIREWALL</h2>
	<p class="w3-opacity">Operation Golden Shield:The Great Firewall and Chinese Censorship</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Internet access is an increasingly important part of daily life around the world, and China is no 
exception. Chinese citizens comprise a massive portion of the world’s internet users, numbering over 700 million in 2016. 
However, Chinese citizens’ access to the internet is restricted by a massively complex system of controls known as the 
Great Firewall to block information that the Chinese government does not want its citizens to access. This portfolio 
examines the cultural impact of the Great Firewall and government censorship on the Chinese people through technical, 
historical, and contemporary lenses. After an introduction to the Great Firewall and Operation Golden Shield,
 the article is comprised of three portions, and includes background readings, information, and gathered material. The first section frames the modern issue of internet censorship in the historical 
and political contexts of ancient Chinese imperial practice and modern Communist policies. The second explains how the 
Chinese government implements internet censorship through government agencies and the technical means used to 
achieve that end. The third section examines how the Great Firewall culturally sandboxes Chinese internet users away 
from the rest of the internet, and looks at the subculture that has developed within, including linguistic connections, mobile 
phone culture, and how effective the government really is at restricting internet access. </p>

	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="w3-opacity">A formal introduction to The Great Firewall.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">The Chinese internet today is a fantastically complicated amalgam of budding enterprise and systemic restrictions. 
While the Chinese government wants the nation’s technology industry to catch up to its international rivals, it muffles a lot of that development by meticulously 
controlling Chinese citizens’ access to the internet. This censorship falls in line with the Chinese Communist party’s modus operandi when it comes to controlling 
the narrative and directing its population with massive undertakings. Chinese internet users number over 600 million today, and they are in many ways cut off from
 the rest of the world in the kinds of information and entertainment that they can access. This results in a fascinating phenomenon from a cultural perspective, 
where the online norms, customs, and tastes of the Chinese people differ vastly from Western culture. Regarding culture as customary traits and norms of a social group,
 it is evident that the Great Firewall and government censorship has a huge impact on Chinese culture, and not just in the online realm. </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I arrived at the decision to examine internet censorship while watching Chinese television, where a news report was detailing a new Chinese 
cybersecurity law that legitimized a lot of their already-ongoing efforts in the realm of internet censorship and surveillance. Among other articles adding to the strength 
of Operation “Golden Shield,” the law stipulates that businesses operating in the country must store their data within China, and cooperate in all matters of technical 
support and national security, which essentially gives the Chinese government a backdoor into a multitude of services in China, and gives the Chinese government 
another level of power over network activity in the country. However, this action is part of an over-arching pattern to control Chinese citizens and their behavior. 
The cultural impact is very clear, from Chinese citizen’s opinions on censorship itself, to the content of microblogs such as Weibo, to the media preferences of 
Chinese citizens everywhere. </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Because of my physical location “behind” the Great Firewall, I was in a unique position to replicate some research into the methods Chinese
 officials use to restrict access to banned websites, and I had easy access to primary sources both online and in the real world. I was able to gently probe some 
Chinese people who were somewhat amenable to discussing these kinds of issues with me, like my Chinese roommate and other college students on campus. 
Older citizens were much more difficult to talk to, they were notoriously vague in response to my questions, and their accents posed a whole other challenge. 
My methodology came from two directions: technical and cultural. On the technical side, I sought to emulate some the research that I came across while 
researching internet censorship in China. On the cultural side, I supplemented interviews with Chinese people with samples of Chinese blog content 
(specifically from Weibo), articles from online, and internet/TV media ranging from advertisements to TV programs and video games. </p>

	<h2><a href="https://tgfirewall.github.io/methods.html">RESEARCH METHODS</a></h2>
	<p class="w3-opacity">Here you can find my methods of research.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">For this project, I used a combination of technical network analysis, interviews with Chinese citizens,
and accessing Chinese websites from within the Chinese internet. I also conducted analysis using DNS response to test DNS poisoning,
 TCP packet testing to detect TCP snooping, and monitoring Chinese social media for censorship evidence. I implemented this using Python
to detect DNS responses, and was able to see the false IP addresses being sent from Chinese DNS servers. Below is a sample of the log file
 from my first run of the program conducted on 22 November 2016.</p>

	<h2>PRELIMINARY FINDINGS</h2>
	<p class="w3-opacity">This is what is currently going on with my project.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I have finished most of the technical analysis and research related to the
 firewall's nature, and I am currently tying the strings of culture and censorship together and transcribing notes
 from talks with two Chinese graduate students and a young teacher about their opinions of internet freedom
 in China. I am also continuing to collect and translate Weibo posts, Baidu news, and TV programs in an effort to paint a picture of
 Chinese internet culture. I also want to add a small but important section on some important Chinese words and phrases
 that are relevant to the project.</p>

	<p class="w3-justify">I expect to arrive at the 70% complete mark by 16 December, 2016. This means that I have uploaded
 my photos, screenshots, materials, notes, and interviews along with the vocabulary portion. I will also develop 
the analytical portion of my findings section, and fill out the historical reference section that is currently missing from the project.
I am holding off on the policy and history portions because I can complete those sections after my return to the US. My
 conclusion will also remain unwritten until my return home.</p>

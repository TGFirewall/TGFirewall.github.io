	<h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
	<p class="w3-justify">The Chinese internet today is a fantastically complicated amalgam of budding enterprise and systemic restrictions. 
While the Chinese government wants the nation’s technology industry to catch up to its international rivals, it muffles a lot of that development by meticulously 
controlling Chinese citizens’ access to the internet. This censorship falls in line with the Chinese Communist party’s modus operandi when it comes to controlling 
the narrative and directing its population with massive undertakings. Chinese internet users number over 600 million today, and they are in many ways cut off from
 the rest of the world in the kinds of information and entertainment that they can access. This results in a fascinating phenomenon from a cultural perspective, 
where the online norms, customs, and tastes of the Chinese people differ vastly from Western culture. Regarding culture as customary traits and norms of a social group,
 it is evident that the Great Firewall and government censorship has a huge impact on Chinese culture, and not just in the online realm. </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I arrived at the decision to examine internet censorship while watching Chinese television, where a news report was detailing a new Chinese 
cybersecurity law that legitimized a lot of their already-ongoing efforts in the realm of internet censorship and surveillance. Among other articles adding to the strength 
of Operation “Golden Shield,” the law stipulates that businesses operating in the country must store their data within China, and cooperate in all matters of technical 
support and national security, which essentially gives the Chinese government a backdoor into a multitude of services in China, and gives the Chinese government 
another level of power over network activity in the country. However, this action is part of an over-arching pattern to control Chinese citizens and their behavior. 
The cultural impact is very clear, from Chinese citizen’s opinions on censorship itself, to the content of microblogs such as Weibo, to the media preferences of 
Chinese citizens everywhere. </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Because of my physical location “behind” the Great Firewall, I was in a unique position to replicate some research into the methods Chinese
 officials use to restrict access to banned websites, and I had easy access to primary sources both online and in the real world. I was able to gently probe some 
Chinese people who were somewhat amenable to discussing these kinds of issues with me, like my Chinese roommate and other college students on campus. 
Older citizens were much more difficult to talk to, they were notoriously vague in response to my questions, and their accents posed a whole other challenge. 
My methodology came from two directions: technical and cultural. On the technical side, I sought to emulate some the research that I came across while 
researching internet censorship in China. On the cultural side, I supplemented interviews with Chinese people with samples of Chinese blog content 
(specifically from Weibo), articles from online, and internet/TV media ranging from advertisements to TV programs and video games. </p>

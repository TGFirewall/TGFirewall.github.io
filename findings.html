<!-- Introduction -->
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center " style="max-width:1000px" id="home">
	<h2>FINDINGS</h2>
	<h4>INTRODUCTION</h4>
	<p class="w3-justify">The Chinese internet today is a fantastically complicated amalgam of budding enterprise and systemic restrictions. 
While the Chinese government wants the nation’s technology industry to catch up to its international rivals, it muffles a lot of that development by meticulously 
controlling Chinese citizens’ access to the internet. This censorship falls in line with the Chinese Communist party’s modus operandi when it comes to controlling 
the narrative and directing its population with massive undertakings. Chinese internet users number over 600 million today, and they are in many ways cut off from
 the rest of the world in the kinds of information and entertainment that they can access. This results in a fascinating phenomenon from a cultural perspective, 
where the online norms, customs, and tastes of the Chinese people differ vastly from Western culture. Regarding culture as customary traits and norms of a social group,
 it is evident that the Great Firewall and government censorship has a huge impact on Chinese culture, and not just in the online realm. </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">I arrived at the decision to examine internet censorship while watching Chinese television, where a news report was detailing a new Chinese 
cybersecurity law that legitimized a lot of their already-ongoing efforts in the realm of internet censorship and surveillance. Among other articles adding to the strength 
of Operation “Golden Shield,” the law stipulates that businesses operating in the country must store their data within China, and cooperate in all matters of technical 
support and national security, which essentially gives the Chinese government a backdoor into a multitude of services in China, and gives the Chinese government 
another level of power over network activity in the country. However, this action is part of an over-arching pattern to control Chinese citizens and their behavior. 
The cultural impact is very clear, from Chinese citizen’s opinions on censorship itself, to the content of microblogs such as Weibo, to the media preferences of 
Chinese citizens everywhere. </p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Because of my physical location “behind” the Great Firewall, I was in a unique position to replicate some research into the methods Chinese
 officials use to restrict access to banned websites, and I had easy access to primary sources both online and in the real world. I was able to gently probe some 
Chinese people who were somewhat amenable to discussing these kinds of issues with me, like my Chinese roommate and other college students on campus. 
Older citizens were much more difficult to talk to, they were notoriously vague in response to my questions, and their accents posed a whole other challenge. 
My methodology came from two directions: technical and cultural. On the technical side, I sought to emulate some the research that I came across while 
researching internet censorship in China. On the cultural side, I supplemented interviews with Chinese people with samples of Chinese blog content 
(specifically from Weibo), articles from online, and internet/TV media ranging from advertisements to TV programs and video games. </p>

<!-- History -->
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-32" style="max-width:1000px" id="history">
	<h4>HISTORY</h4>
	<p class="w3-opacity">The Chinese culture of collectivism.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Before diving into the realm of modern culture in China, I want to first frame these findings within a historical context. China has a history of a powerful centralized state exerting tremendous control over the common people, tracing back to the Ming and Qing dynasties <a href="#source1">(1)</a>. Dr. Hucker makes the following observation when discussing the censorial heritage in China, saying that “part of the distinctive Chinese style or mode of life is self-evaluation, a compulsion to examine, rationalize, and justify ones actions” <a href="#source2">(2)</a>. 
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">From the early dynasties in China, government regulation of speech and expression was extremely important, and the Ming dynasty censorship program was highly developed, and “was an elaborately organized and highly systemized effort by the government to police… and discover violations of public policy… to maintain a governmental tone that accorded as closely as possible with the Chinese (government) ideal” <a href="#source3">(3)</a>. Indeed throughout Chinese history, the prevailing theme has been a goal or preserving social harmony through the suppression of outside ideas by the government, take for example this excerpt regarding the later Qing dynasty: “Civilization meant, among other things, the recording of knowledge, and those who controlled that record held the keys to state legitimacy” <a href="#source4">(4)</a>. Within this framework of state control of information, the ruling elements of China have kept a vise-like grip on freedom of expression and dissident ideas for hundreds of years. Today, this has transitioned into the preservation of the Communist party control over the country, and a significant portion of censorship efforts have been directed towards that goal, all in the name of preserving the “harmonious society.”
	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">This principle of harmony led quite conveniently into the rise of social collectivism when the Communist party rose to power in the late 1940’s, and censorship persisted with the goal of preserving social structure. This association of unwanted foreign ideas with the disruption of social harmony has been cemented in Chinese people’s minds for generations, and this mentality manifests itself in modern Chinese culture in many ways, including self-censorship and the Chinese habit of avoidance of sensitive subjects in the interest of maintaining social unity. China has long held the notion of citizen privacy to be far less sacred than that of its western peers, and the continuing censorship and surveillance of China deeply affects Chinese culture from behavioral norms to conversation topics both online and in the real world.</p>

<!-- Policy & Implementation -->
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-32" style="max-width:1000px" id="policy">
	<h4>POLICY & IMPLEMENTATION</h4>
	<p class="w3-opacity">How a government can control the content of 1.4 billion people.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Internet censorship in China came almost in tandem with the arrival of the internet in the late 1990s, and first required traffic routing through government owned Internet Service Providers or ISPs<a href="#source5">(5)</a>. This regulation was quickly bulked by the Chinese ministry of public security to prohibit “harmful activities” and assert the country’s right to control over the internet<a href="#source6">(6)</a> These harmful activities quickly developed into a broad definition ranging from violent or pornographic content to any attempts to undermine government authority<a href="#source7">(7)</a>. From there, the Chinese government established state media channels for publishing content online, and began the practice of placing legal responsibility of censoring content on ISPs and content organizations, encouraging self-censorship for political, personal, and economic motivation<a href="#source8">(8)</a>. This trend continues to this day, and has trickled down to the average Chinese internet user. The consequences for subversion of the state online are fairly serious, and dozens of activists and reporters have disappeared into China’s prison system in the wake of imprudent remarks online.<a href="#sourcea">(A)</a></p>
	<p class="w3-justify">This threat of serious consequences has led to the extremely common practice of using ISPs to censor content. ISPs in China, fearing repercussions from the Chinese government, self-censor in an effort to keep themselves online and in working order<a href="https://censorbib.nymity.ch/pdf/Knockel2015a.pdf">(Knockel 2015)</a>. This practice is an effort of self-preservation by many companies, and many foreign companies used to have access to Chinese markets because of this compliance, Google is a good example of such an entity <a href="#source9">(9)</a>. While Google stopped this practice of self-censorship and pulled out of the Chinese market in 2010, but in their absence, the laws and organizations restricting the internet access of 500 million Chinese have grown significantly stronger over time. China moved its internet control into an exclusive agency in 2014 under president Xi Jinping, naming the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) the overseeing authority in all internet related matters <a href="source10">(10)</a></p>
	<p class="w3-justify">Today, the CAC is responsible for managing and directing the thousands of internet regulators employed by the government, issuing policy on Chinese internet use, and censoring content, along with some alleged cyber operations including a 2015 attack on Github <a href="#source11">(11)</a>. This means everything from controlling content by employing a number of technical methods, to ensuring Chinese ISP’s comply with government policy, all in compliance with the goal of constricting the average citizen’s access to the free internet <a href="#source12">(12)</a>.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">The methods actually used have changed rapidly over the years in accordance with the development of the internet as a technology, and over the years methods have ranged from Domain Name Service poisoning on Chinese servers, to packet dropping, to other more sophisticated<a href="https://tgfirewall.github.io/#related">methods</a>, composing a strong level of internet controls called “the Great Firewall.” However the two largest elements of the operation are statues encouraging self-censorship on an enterprise and users levels, and the employ of millions of manual censors who look for “questionable content.” <a href="#source13">(13)</a>. The scale of this operation boggles the mind, and is dubbed “The Golden Shield” by its advocates in Beijing <a href="#sourceb">(B)</a>. The firewall can be technically analyzed rather easily, and the three main methods used to block access are DNS poisoning, router control, and TCP packet dropping of unencrypted traffic <a href="https://tgfirewall.github.io/methods.html">(See Methods Here)</a>. After the firewall, content providers in China like Weibo and Baidu carefully self-censor to stay in the good graces of the government and keep a strangle-hold on the ridiculously lucrative Chinese market. Beyond that, the ministry of propaganda and now the CAC hires millions of “50 cent party” members to manipulate social media content to the liking of Communist party members <a href="source14">(14)</a>. 
	<p class="w3-justify">This massive effort is extremely effective at controlling the content of millions of Chinese, and allows the Communist party to control a lot of the national narrative when things happen in the world. This year, the CAC added to its power by passing a new <a href="https://tgfirewall.github.io/#law">law</a> that puts a lot of the previously-vaguely described surveillance into cybersecurity law, and grossly expanding censorship and surveillance tools. One of the most controversial elements is its treatment of foreign companies. Foreign companies wishing to operate in China must store their data on Chinese soil, and potentially back-door any software for authorities that may need it. This is deeply concerning on a number of levels, especially considering that Facebook is considering making another play to the Chinese market by complying with Chinese censorship and other expectations for social media software. The average westerner would look at these developments with a minimum of serious concern, if not outright worry and outrage, but many Chinese fail to see the seriousness of the situation, and that is one of the many cultural results of this prolonged suppression of information on Chinese soil.</p>

<!-- Impact -->
<div class="w3-container w3-content w3-center w3-padding-32" style="max-width:1000px" id="impact">
	<h4>CULTURAL IMPACT</h4>
	<p class="w3-opacity">Cultural Implications today and in the future. // Coming Soon</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">China’s repeated rejection of the concept of personal liberty is a result of the Communist underpinnings that still define the state, and this produces two distinct families of cultural impacts. The first is more surface level and has to do with the content and quality of internet media consumption, the prevalence of slang, and some of the subversions of that “harmonious society” ideal by internet users today. The second is much deeper, and suggests some of the cultural values that reflect and result from prolonged internet censorship in China regarding privacy, liberty, and self-expression.</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">On the first and most obvious cultural impact, China’s sandboxing of the internet from the outside world has given rise to an internet and popular culture within China that belongs to no other country. From app ecosystem, to social media outlets, to search engines, Chinese citizens have little in common with the online habits of Westerners. In the absence of Google, search giant Baidu has taken over the Middle Kingdom. An interesting characteristic of Chinese services is the embedded nature of ads: rather than use Google ads team to generate advertising revenue, Baidu.com promotes its own “clickbait,” much like content would find from a family member on Facebook about something totally absurd. </p>

	</p>
	<p class="w3-justify">
	Beyond search, intellectual property rights are a joke in China, and on many massive websites users can find high-quality pirated videos and songs, which makes for an interesting experience when trying to explain Spotify or Netflix to Chinese users when they can get the same service for free albeit with a few ads.  Chinese produced TV shows have yet to really reach western production quality, and the Chinese hip-hop scene is not quite as well established as in the United States, so they either use pirated content or settle for Chinese content, which is often the case. However, because all television is owned and run by the state, the content becomes another repeater in a Chinese citizen’s bubble of “harmonious life.” </p>
